## Overview
LIVE DEMO: https://devserena.herokuapp.com/

This application built with only react, tailwind and css was spent carefully. This was fun to put together, I wanted a unique feel that goes towards my personal interests but also my skills and what I can bring forth to the table. I learned how to use tailwind without relying heavily on css. Less files to mess with!
